Twitch Highlight Downloader Automation

This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of fetching and downloading highlights from your Twitch channel created within the last 48 hours. It leverages the Twitch API to retrieve video details and uses the TwitchDownloaderCLI to download the videos locally.

Features
Automated Retrieval of Highlights:
Fetches highlights from the Twitch API for your channel, filtering by a specified time range (default: last 48 hours).

Video Downloads Using TwitchDownloaderCLI:
Automatically downloads highlights using the TwitchDownloaderCLI tool.

Secure Credential Handling:

Sensitive data, such as the Twitch Client ID and OAuth token, is stored in a .env file.
The .env file is ignored in version control using .gitignore.
Custom Output Directory:
Saves downloaded highlights to a folder named twitch_highlights, which is created automatically if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

Prerequisites
Tools and Libraries
TwitchDownloaderCLI:

Download and install from the official repository.
Ensure it is added to your system's PATH.
Python 3.7+:

Install Python and the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install requests python-dotenv
Twitch API Credentials:

Create an application in the Twitch Developer Console.
Generate a Client ID and OAuth token.
Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitch-highlight-downloader.git
cd twitch-highlight-downloader
Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:

bash
Copy code
touch .env
Add the following lines to .env:

env
Copy code
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN=your_oauth_token
Ensure .env is ignored by Git:

bash
Copy code
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
Usage
Running the Script
Ensure TwitchDownloaderCLI is installed and configured.
Execute the script:
bash
Copy code
python download_highlights.py
Output
The script will:
Retrieve all highlights created within the last 48 hours.
Download each highlight as an .mp4 file to the twitch_highlights folder.
Considerations
Rate Limits:
The Twitch API enforces rate limits. If you're fetching highlights for a large user base or repeatedly testing, ensure you stay within the Twitch API limits.

Time Range:
The script is configured to retrieve highlights from the last 48 hours. Modify the TWO_DAYS_AGO variable in the script if you need a different range.

Error Handling:
Basic error handling is included to manage HTTP errors from the Twitch API. Improve this logic for production use.

Platform Compatibility:
The script assumes a Unix-based shell environment (macOS/Linux). Windows users should ensure subprocess.run is compatible with their system's CLI setup.

Dependencies:
Ensure Python 3.7+ and required libraries (requests, python-dotenv) are installed.

Example Workflow
A Twitch user has created highlights over the past 48 hours.
This script:
Retrieves the highlights from the Twitch API.
Uses TwitchDownloaderCLI to save the highlights as .mp4 files.
The final .mp4 files are stored in the twitch_highlights directory, ready for use.
Contribution
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the script. Suggestions for enhanced error handling, extended functionality, or additional CLI integrations are welcome!
